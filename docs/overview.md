# Overview

Welcome to the Video Device xAPI Lab

In this lab, we'll cover Cisco's Video Device xAPI, how to access this xAPI on real hardware and use this xAPI to build a new solution for you to tailor the device to fit a target use case.

We'll take this a step further and show you how to deploy this new solution using our Webex Control Hub cloud management service
